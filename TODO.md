# TODO

## General

Priority 1

- Handle responsiveness everywhere
- Firestore DB: set more robust security rules
- Loading and images:
  - Design a loading theme (skeleton, icon, wheel?) and use it whenever loading is required (e.g. while posting newsletter form)
  - Pre-load all images. Add a loading animation while pre-loading the images (same as mcm)?
  - Resize images (especially products) to a smaller size if possible (for better performance)
  - Remove unused images? (or make sure they are not loaded if not used)
- Add animation when expanding/collapsing dot content + other animations?
- All other TO DOs in the project
- dot page: for big mobiles, have a bigger font for dot menu
- dot menu: + and - should be in respira font, and smaller
- dot menu: on hover, change font color instead of making it bold
- Check if we can get more info on the subscribers when they fill the form (location, user agent?)
- For height 720px (and around), is it possible to make the tree fully visible?
- In dot page, in desktop view, center the slogan horizontally (same distance from left border as from door logo)
- Add a box shadow (very light) under the header - add it only for dot view (e.g. box-shadow: 1px 0px 6px #ddd;)
- When hovering the navbar menu titles, in order to avoid text overlapping, we should ideally add a white or black semi-transparent layer on the whole page (see https://nakashimawoodworkers.com/)
- newsletter form error "Invalid email address" overlaps the "look up" logo

Priority 2

- Create npm scripts that will facilitate git flows and deployment
- Dot footer: align top right text with top of center image in desktop view
- Fix css warnings on ng serve
- Favicon: make it work on all browsers, and in dark mode

## Legal

- Should we add something in a LICENCE file, or in credits (footer?) related to the fonts used? Same for images.
