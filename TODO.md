# TODO

## General

- Fix css warnings on ng serve
- Pre-load all images. Add a loading animation while pre-loading the images (same as mcm)?
- Resize images (especially products) to a smaller size if possible (for better performance)
- Remove unused images? (or make sure they are not loaded if not used)

## Legal

- Should we add something in a LICENCE file, or in credits (footer?) related to the fonts used? Same for images.
