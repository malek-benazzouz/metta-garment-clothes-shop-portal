# TODO

## General

- Handle responsiveness everywhere
- Fix css warnings on ng serve
- Pre-load all images. Add a loading animation while pre-loading the images (same as mcm)?
- Design a loading theme (skeleton, icon, wheel?) and use it whenever loading is required (e.g. while posting newsletter form)
- Resize images (especially products) to a smaller size if possible (for better performance)
- Remove unused images? (or make sure they are not loaded if not used)
- Create an admin page, accessible via authentication, to check the firebase DB content
- Firestore DB: set more robust security rules

## Legal

- Should we add something in a LICENCE file, or in credits (footer?) related to the fonts used? Same for images.
