# TODO

## General

- Handle responsiveness everywhere
- Fix css warnings on ng serve
- Pre-load all images. Add a loading animation while pre-loading the images (same as mcm)?
- Design a loading theme (skeleton, icon, wheel?) and use it whenever loading is required (e.g. while posting newsletter form)
- Resize images (especially products) to a smaller size if possible (for better performance)
- Remove unused images? (or make sure they are not loaded if not used)
- Create an admin page, accessible via authentication, to check the firebase DB content
- Firestore DB: set more robust security rules
- Update favicon logo and page title (tab title)

## Legal

- Should we add something in a LICENCE file, or in credits (footer?) related to the fonts used? Same for images.

## Further to checkpoint with Ludo

- Cart in wrapping noctural green rectangle, with an external link on "cart" text
- Footer: align footer links vertically to the door image (see mockup)
- Update positioning of text under sun product image
- Update positioning of sun product and moon product images (horizontally centered with sun and moon)
- Increase left margin on Metta logo and right margin on navbar menu + right margin of footer text
- Put the right margin between the two navbar menu items

## Questions to Ludo 

- Should we update title attributes or remove them? Metta logo + dot
- Should we remove bold style from dot menu (mobile only) after the click?
- Do we really want to use font-weight 500 on nav menu items on hover? 600 seems more adapted to me -> compare both options
- Newsletter form: connect underline with submit button if possible -> I do not recommend, since it creates a color mismatch

## Resources needed from Ludo

- Product images, names, price, description
- Real links to all pages + link to cart
