# TODO

## General

- Handle responsiveness everywhere
- Fix css warnings on ng serve
- Pre-load all images. Add a loading animation while pre-loading the images (same as mcm)?
- Design a loading theme (skeleton, icon, wheel?) and use it whenever loading is required (e.g. while posting newsletter form)
- Resize images (especially products) to a smaller size if possible (for better performance)
- Remove unused images? (or make sure they are not loaded if not used)
- Create an admin page, accessible via authentication, to check the firebase DB content
- Firestore DB: set more robust security rules
- Update favicon logo and page title (tab title)

## Legal

- Should we add something in a LICENCE file, or in credits (footer?) related to the fonts used? Same for images.

## Further to checkpoint with Ludo

- Either add Respira font, or replace all leaves images with new ones (containing the right font)
- Cart in wrapping noctural green rectangle, with an external link on "cart" text
- Update title attributes or remove them if needed
- Update fonts: all in beVietnam except dot-menu on Mobile
- Keep dot menu only on mobile - no bold
- Update font sizes and typographies -> minimum 14px (in web design system, in "Apx, Bpx" -> A = desktop, B = mobile)
- Footer: align footer links vertically to the door image (see mockup)
- Newsletter form: connect underline with submit button if possible
- Update red and green colors for form validation
- Update positioning of text under sun product image
- Update positioning of sun product and moon product images (horizontally centered with sun and moon)
- Increase left margin on Metta logo and right margin on navbar menu
- Put the right margin between the two navbar menu items
- Download all the new files (mockups, images...) updated by Ludo, including web design system
