# TODO

## Priority 1

- Mobile product page:
  - Allow to scroll if feet are not visible
  - On Ludo's phone, feet are not visible but border is overlapping picture

- All occurrences of `TODO prodReadiness`

## Priority 2

- Make slogan clickable + split in 2:
  - Spiritualiser: https://door.metta-garment.com/the-essence-garment/
  - Matérialiser: https://door.metta-garment.com/the-life-garment/
- In dot page, in desktop view, center the slogan horizontally (same distance from left border as from door logo)
- Add animation when expanding/collapsing dot content + other animations?
- Loading and images:
  - Pre-load all images
  - Resize images (especially products) to a smaller size if possible (for better performance)
  - Remove unused images? (or make sure they are not loaded if not used)
- Firestore DB: set more robust security rules
- Check if we can get more info on the subscribers when they fill the form (location, user agent?)
- For height 720px (and around), is it possible to make the tree fully visible?
- Favicon: make it work on all browsers, and in dark mode
- Set cookies to avoid coming-soon page for users that already subscribed

## Priority 3

- Create npm scripts that will facilitate git flows and deployment
- Fix css warnings on ng serve
